# Capability Model

## Purpose

Defines the minimal professional capability set and maturity path for the `testing` master skill.

## Minimal Core Capability Set

1. requirement-to-test traceability
2. risk-based test prioritization
3. multi-layer functional design (unit to end-to-end)
4. regression impact analysis
5. CI and CD quality gate logic
6. baseline non-functional checks (performance and security)
7. defect triage and release recommendation
8. measurable quality reporting

## Capability Coverage Decision

Mandatory in scope:
- test case generation
- risk-based prioritization
- regression impact analysis
- CI and CD integration logic
- observability feedback loop
- performance profiling
- security scanning orchestration
- auto-refactoring support for test maintainability

## Maturity Levels

L1 Basic:
- manual policy enforcement
- static scope selection
- basic pass/fail reporting

L2 Managed:
- risk-based prioritization
- automated gate orchestration
- trend-based quality reporting

L3 Adaptive:
- dynamic impact-aware test selection
- observability-driven reprioritization
- predictive release risk insights

## Dependency View

Fundamental capabilities:
- strategy and architecture
- risk management

Advanced capabilities:
- automation intelligence
- observability feedback loop
- auto-refactoring support

Infra-level capabilities:
- environment provisioning
- test data lifecycle
- virtualization and parity controls

Business-level capabilities:
- governance policy and approvals
- release readiness metrics and risk reporting

## Architecture Recommendation

Use a hybrid model:
1. layered control plane and execution plane
2. domain-driven sections for each testing category
3. plugin-based extensions for future capabilities
4. capability matrix for maturity tracking
