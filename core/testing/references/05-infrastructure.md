# Infrastructure

## Module Identity

Category prefix:
- `testing.infrastructure.*`

Naming pattern:
- `testing.infrastructure.<layer>.<capability>.<maturity>`
- Example: `testing.infrastructure.env.ephemeral-provisioning.L2`

## SDLC Stage

Primary stages:
- environment setup
- CI integration
- release preparation

Continuous stage:
- production-like test readiness maintenance

## Problems Solved

- environment drift between local, CI, and staging
- brittle test data and dependency setup
- unstable integration testing due to external dependencies
- pipeline instability from non-deterministic environments

## Integration Points

Depends on:
- platform and DevOps standards

Works with:
- `testing.automation.*`
- `testing.nonfunctional.*`

Feeds into:
- `testing.governance.*` as readiness evidence
- `testing.metrics.*` for environment health indicators

## Core Infrastructure Areas

1. ephemeral and reproducible test environments
2. test data lifecycle and masking strategy
3. service virtualization and contract stubs
4. environment parity controls
5. runtime observability hooks for testing feedback

## Design Rules

1. Make environment provisioning repeatable and versioned.
2. Isolate test data concerns from production data risk.
3. Enforce parity checks before release-critical test runs.
4. Keep infrastructure signals visible to QA governance.
