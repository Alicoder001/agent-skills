# UI Design Guidelines

> Practical design rules for modern web interfaces.

## Instructions

### 1. Define Constraints
- Capture audience, brand tone, and platform targets.
- Note accessibility requirements and performance constraints.
- Identify key content types and critical user flows.

### 2. Layout and Hierarchy
- Use a clear grid and spacing scale (4pt or 8pt).
- Limit content width for readability; define breakpoints.
- Make primary actions and key data visually dominant.

### 3. Typography System
- Define a type scale (e.g., 12/14/16/20/24/32/40).
- Keep body text at 16px or higher with 1.4 to 1.6 line height.
- Use weight and size to encode hierarchy, not color alone.

### 4. Color and Contrast
- Use semantic tokens (primary, success, warning, danger).
- Ensure text contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text).
- Keep the palette small; rely on neutrals for backgrounds.

### 5. Spacing and Rhythm
- Apply consistent padding and margin rules across components.
- Align baselines and edges to reduce visual noise.
- Avoid mixing unrelated spacing values.

### 6. Components and States
- Define default, hover, active, focus, disabled, and error states.
- Make focus indicators visible and consistent.
- Ensure forms have clear labels and error messages.

### 7. Responsive Behavior
- Stack columns on small screens.
- Keep tap targets at least 44px.
- Avoid horizontal scroll and layout shifts.

### 8. Motion (Optional)
- Use motion for feedback and continuity, not decoration.
- Keep durations short (150 to 250ms) and easing consistent.
